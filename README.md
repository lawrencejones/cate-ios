#CateMate

Lets face it, CATe's not cool. She's the odd one out, 
the turquoise/yellow-black sheep in the flock.
Her only saving grace? She's pretty damn clever.

This app works by downloading the content directly from CATe, 
after which it processes the data and presents it in (what we think) 
is a sexier form. CATe's basic functionality is (as of now) totally untouched. 
We take the good stuff so that you don't have to deal with the bad.

##What Content?
CATe provides students with a few main feeds of information about their studies.

1. **College Identity Information**
2. **Exercise and Handin Resources**
3. **Module Grades**
4. **Project Information (portal)**
5. Student Database (TeachDB)
6. Module Registration

We currently have 1-4 programmed in, with scraping implemented. Our goal however is to
canvas the entirety of CATe before full release of the app. If we've missed out any
features that you're DYING to see included, then feel free to either request it directly
or to implement it yourself.

##Pull-Request Policy
We're all in the same college, in the same dept, studying the same content... I'm sure
you see where I'm going. CATe's a burden we all have to shoulder, why shouldn't we
work together to make it better?!?

We welcome collaboration of any kind, especially cool stuff. 
<br>So go ahead, give it a go.


Dare ya.

##Future Plans
We have some exciting plans for this app, some really cool interactive ideas we'd
love to see play out. That's pretty far ahead at the moment though, so this section's
not going to see much action till the app's fully implemented and we've got the bugs
well and truly squashed.

Any ideas from you though and we'd love to know! You can email us at either
[lmj112](mailto:lmj112@ic.ac.uk) or [tbh12](mailto:tbh12@ic.ac.uk) and we'll aim
to respond asap. <br>Elsewise, just track Tom down in the dept, or me down in a bar.

This is an awesome project.<br>No, seriously. It makes ours look incredibly boring. Peter 
started the whole CATe scraping craze, and as our dept president he's the one to go to
about any ideas and extensions you want to make to the college system.<br>
We've made direct use of the **Classy-Cate** algorithms besides our own in this project, 
so all thanks to Peter for his hard work.</span>

Beast of a framework. Made short work of CATe. Just sayin.
